                                More equipment “walks out the door” than you might imagine. Equipment gets
                                informally transferred from one employee to another,
                                and then a replacement is ordered leading to more expense than is really necessary.
                                Time is spent searching for lost or misplaced
                                items causing frustration and lost productivity. The purchasing process becomes
                                chaotic with “urgent” requests to buy lost or misplaced
                                items that are needed immediately.
                            </p>

                                Individuals are accountable for the equipment assigned to them. Summary reporting
                                helps identify whether company assets are being
                                deployed productively. Purchasing decisions can be made based on rational planning
                                and real business needs. Infrequently used items
                                can be located quickly when needed, reducing frustration and time lost searching for
                                them. Asset Management at the small group level
                                may involve a check out sheet such as a “key log” or “tool room list” which
                                employees sign when receiving or returning an item.
                                At the company level, an Asset Management process often involves computer based
                                tools which can be as simple as a spreadsheet of items,
                                or a more robust system which uses Asset Management Software to store the details in
                                a database and manage the transfer of items from one
                                employee or location to another. </p>
